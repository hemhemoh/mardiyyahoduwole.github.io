I am an independent ML Researcher at ML Collective with a strong focus on Multilingual NLP, and ML Efficiency. My current interests revolve around making language technologies accessible to underserved communities, particularly in the Global South, who are often underrepresented and access to resources is limited. This shapes my projects, including the exploration of model compression techniques for LLMs, using quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, to ensure that these models are efficient and scalable. 

My research also explores the intersection of multilinguality, data scarcity, and cultural inclusivity, with a focus (for now) on African languages and their sign languages. I have contributed to the creation of datasets like MasakhaNEWS, a benchmark for news topic classification across African languages, and investigated the effects of data augmentation techniques for machine translation in low-resource African languages. My current work includes the development of a multimodal, multilingual LLM for African languages, combining vision models with multilingual text decoders, as well as pioneering efforts in real-time sign language translation to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired community in sub-Saharan Africa.
